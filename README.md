# StenoTalons

The goal of this project is to create a FOSS Wireless wearable
Stenoboard. This project shall remain FOSS (GPL3.0/[CC4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode))
like the mother application [Plover stenography](https://www.openstenoproject.org/plover/).
This application obviously uses a Plover bird as it's identifier and namesake,
thus the name StenoTalons is to pay homage to the avian roots.
